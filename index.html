    <p>Hi! My name is Katie. I hope you enjoy visiting wonderchildanimation.co.uk</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="main-text">Ever wanted to have a go at animation? I found an old copy of Anime Debut 6 on the internet for a few pounds and decided I would take a look. It was mind boggling at first as I had never animated anything, ever! I had no idea what I was looking at or how to use it.</p>
    <p class="main-text">Not wanting to be put off I turned to the endless oracle of tutorials...Youtube! In no time I had spliced together a very short animation featuring my Mum and a very annoying bird. Was it good? No, no it was not. None the less I really wanted to have a go at creating something a bit better.</p>
    <p class="main-text">I ended up making a short film for a freind of mine with whome I share a mutual love of gaming. it took many hours of learning, many hours of figuring out why things were not working the way they should and a long time after being very proud of what I had made.</p>
    <p class="main-text">my goal here is to create a space that anyone who is interested in having a go at basic animation can use to find a place to start. Here you will find a range of resourses available to use at will, software recomendations and a growing community of people interested in supporting and guiding each other. </p>
    <p class="main-text">It really doesnt matter if you are any good at art or not, animation is so much more than that. You can tell a story with stick men after all!</p>
